          <h2>Wolf Team</h2>
          <h4>Wolves</h4>
          foobar
          <h4>Traitor</h4>
          The traitor is a villager but is on the wolf team. To a seer they appear as a normal villager but can be revealed by the detective. Shooting a traitor will not instantly kill them like with wolves.
          <dt id="foobar"><h4>Werecrow</h4></dt>
          The werecrow (aka, crow) is a little like a seer for the wolf team. At night, they can observe villagers and be informed if they were sleeping (the observed is a villager) or up at night (the observed is a special role).
