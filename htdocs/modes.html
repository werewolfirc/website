    <p>Game modes are different configurations that alter the number and types of roles in the game. They can also change certain other settings, such as the likelihood of a shaman receiving a specific totem.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The following is a list of the game modes currently available, and a description of the main differences compared to the usual rules (henceforth referred to as the <i>default</i> mode).</p>
    <h3>Main modes</h3>
    <p>These modes may be picked at random by the bot if there is no consensus in favor of any specific mode.</p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-striped sortable">

        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Default</td>
        <td>The standard mode, used if no other mode fails to gain a majority of votes. See <a href="howtoplay">how to play</a> for a description.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Foolish</td>
        <td>Contains the fool - be careful not to lynch them!</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Lycan</td>
        <td>Contains lycans, who will turn into wolves. Hunt them down before the wolves overpower the village.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Aleatoire</td>
        <td>Contains a medley of roles on both sides, and modified totem chances for the shaman.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Alpha</td>
        <td>Contains the alpha wolf, who can turn others into wolves. Be careful who you trust!</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>Other modes</h3>
    <p>These modes cannot be selected randomly - a majority of users must vote for them.
