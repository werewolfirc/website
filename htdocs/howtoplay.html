    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Werewolf is an IRC game based on the Mafia party game. Roles are randomly distributed to the players at the beginning of the game. There are two teams: The werewolves and the villagers, both of whom attempt to kill each other. The game ends when the villagers have found all wolves or when the werewolves equal or outnumber the number of alive villagers.</p>
    <p>Whereas the werewolves are aware of their fellows, the villagers are unaware of others' roles and must figure out these either by guessing or through the use of special roles. The werewolves can communicate through the bot (commonly referred to as the "wolfchat").</p>
    <p>The game follows a cycle of two phases: night and day. The game starts with a night, which lasts up to 2 minutes or when all night specials have acted. During the night, the werewolves pick a victim, and the other special roles use their abilities. When nighttime ends, the village is informed of the victim and other deaths. Day lasts up to 12 minutes, or when a majority votes to lynch one player. Day is also when the detective role and the gunner can use their special abilities.</p>
    <p>When a majority has been reached, the target is killed and the village is informed of their actual role. The game enters another night phase if there are werewolves remaining. The game ends if all wolves have been killed or if the wolves outnumber the remaining villagers.</p>
    <h2>Roles</h2>
    <p>After the game is started, the Werewolf bot (lykos) will choose a random set of players and assign them roles. The roles that are assigned are determined by a <a href="modes">game mode</a>, which can be voted on by players before the game starts. Not everyone has a role, so if you don't get a PM, sit back and wait for day.</p>
    <p><em>Note:</em> This list is for the default game mode. There may be additional roles not described here present if another mode is used. Future updates to this documentation will include them; for now, feel free to ask in the channel between games.
    <h3>Village roles</h3>
    <dl class="compact long wsp">
      <dt>Villager</dt>
      <dd>The villager is the base role in the village team. They're present in every game and have no special abilities. Their main task is to lynch all the wolves .</dd>
      <dt>Seer<br />(4 players)</dt>
      <dd>The seer is a village role present in every game. They have the ability to discover the role of another player during night by issuing the command <code>see &lt;player&gt;</code> However, if the seer tries to discover the role of the cursed villager (see below), they will be seen as a wolf. A traitor is seen as a villager and a werecrow is seen as just a wolf. A seer can only see one player per night and the result is returned immediately, enabling the seer to relay information during night. As the seer is a very important and powerful role, they should generally not reveal to the village and instead let another safe lead.</dd>
      <dt>Cursed villager<br />(6/20 players)</dt> <!-- Move this to a separate Templates section -->
      <dd>The cursed villager is a normal villager who appears as a wolf to the seer. The cursed villager is unaware of their role, but the cursed villager is known to the wolf team. Any player except wolwes, werecrows, and seers can be cursed. This means that a seer seeing a wolf is not definite proof of their wolf role. In large games with 20 players or more, there will be two cursed villagers.</dd>
      <dt>Shaman<br />(7 players)</dt>
      <dd>The shaman is a villager capable of giving out a random totem every night. They can give a totem to themselves, but are unable to give a totem to the same player two nights in a row. At dawn, the player who received the totem is revealed, but the public is unaware of who gave the totem and which totem it was. <!-- maybe a link to a strategy page here -->
      <dt>Harlot (8 players)</dt>
      <dd>The harlot is a villager who can visit other players at night and therefore evade wolf attacks. The action is immediate and the target is also made aware of the visit. The harlot can also choose to not visit anyone (by visiting themselves). If the wolf team attempts to kill a harlot who is currently visiting someone, the attempt will fail. However, if a harlot visits a wolf, they will die. In addition, if the harlot is visiting the target of the wolf team, the harlot will also die. As the harlot cannot be killed directly by the wolves, the role makes for a good public safe.</dd>
      <dt>Gunner (10 players)</dt>
      <dd>The gunner has the ability to shoot other players with silver bullets during daytime. The gunner usually has two bullets (three in large games), but village drunk-gunners have six. If the gunner shoots a werewolf, it will die. If the gunner shoots an innocent villager, the villager will be unable to vote that day and will also count towards the player tally. This means that the gunner should refrain from shooting if there is only one more villager than werewolves. There is also a small chance that the gunner accidentally headshots a villager, killing them; or accidentally kills themselves by exploding. If the wolves kill the gunner, they can steal one bullet from them and use it against the village. However, a wolf-gunner cannot kill another wolf, which means that a gunner who successfully kills a werewolf is always fullsafe.</dd>
      <dt>Detective (12 players)</dt>
      <dd>The detective's role in the game is to investigate players during the day. Compared to the seer, the detective has the advantage of being able to detect the true roles of the traitor and cursed villager; however, they risk (2/5 chance) revealing themselves to the werewolves every time they investigate someone. The detective is an important asset to the village, which is why the guardian angel (if present) should almost always guard the detective.</dd>
      <dt>Guardian angel (17 players)</dt>
      <dd>The Guardian angel is roughly the opposite of the harlot; rather than escaping attack, they protect other players. Guardian angels can still be killed by Werewolves in the normal way, as well as having a 50% chance of dying if they choose to guard a werewolf. Their true identity will not be revealed to the person they are guarding. As there's a 50% chance of the Guardian angel living after guarding a wolf, it is useless to claim GA-safe.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Werewolf roles</h3>
    <p>The goal of the Werewolves is to kill and outnumber the villagers. The wolves have the advantage of being able to communicate with each other through the wolfchat (by msg'ing lykos). This enables easy coordination between the different wolf roles.</p>
    <dl class="compact long wsp">
      <dt>Wolf</dt>
      <dd>
        The wolf forms the backbone of the wolfteam. One game can have up to four wolves; they are assigned at the following player counts:
        <dl class="compact shortish nm">
          <!-- Usually all digits are the same width in most fonts, using an invisible 0 for correct spacing for "4" here. -->
          <dt>
            <span class="invisible">0</span>4 players
          </dt>
          <dd>first wolf</dd>
          <dt>10 players</dt>
          <dd>second wolf</dd>
          <dt>15 players</dt>
          <dd>third wolf</dd>
          <dt>20 players</dt>
          <dd>fourth wolf</dd>
        </dl>
        The wolves' special ability is to select a target at night and kill them. The wolves can discuss whom to kill, and the target with most votes will be killed.
      </dd>
      <dt>Traitor (8 players)</dt>
      <dd>The traitor is a werewolf role that appears in games with 8 players or more. The traitor has an important role in that they appear to be a normal villager until all other werewolves have died. This ensures "half-safes" aren't completely safe as they could be a traitor. Whereas the seer (see above) sees the traitor as a villager, the traitor can still be cursed (see above) and therefore be seen as wolf. Also, the detective (see above) can find out the true role of a traitor.</dd>
      <dt>Werecrow (12 players)</dt>
      <dd>The werecrow has two special abilities. Like the normal wolves, the werecrow can vote to kill a selected target. However, the werecrow has another, more important ability that they should use whenever applicable. The werecrow can observe players, finding out whether they have night roles or not. This means that the werecrow can find out if a player is seer or harlot. The werecrow should always observe a player when there is one or more alive wolf. However, if all other wolves are dead, the werecrow should kill rather than observe. A seer sees a werecrow as a wolf, but a detective IDs them as a werecrow, and when shot and lynched, they appear to be a wolf, however, !stats can be used to discover whether the werecrow is alive.</dd>
